Test-Driven Development is great. If you're a Pythonista, it gets even better with pytest - a framework that makes building simple and scalable tests easy.

In this series, I'll be exploring the cool features that pytest offers to help make testing Python code a breeze.

## Preparing your python environment

Let's set up our testing environment with `virtualenv`. We'll be working with Python 3. `cd` into your working directory and create a new virtual environment:

```shell
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing `pytest`

```shell
pip install pytest
```

That's all you need to do to get pytest ready. You can check the installed version by running:

```shell
pytest --version
```

## Creating your first test

Say we need to create an app that says hello to the name you give it when it runs (I know, very original ðŸ˜…).

```python
# simple hello world test

def hello_world(name):
    pass

def test_hello():
    assert hello_world("World!") == "Hello World!"
```

You'll notice that our test function name begins with the word _test_. That's how pytest discoveres test methods. Also, :

- Test files should be named `test_<something>.py` or `<something>_test.py`
- Test classes should be named `Test<Something>`

Running `pytest hello.py` should return:

```shell
collected 1 item
hello.py F                         [100%]

===================== FAILURES ======================
    def test_hello():
>       assert hello_world("World!") == "Hello World!"
E       AssertionError: assert None == 'Hello World!'
E        +  where None = hello_world('World!')

hello.py:6: AssertionError
```

Pytest shows why the test failed: `AssertionError: assert None == 'Hello World!â€™`. Obviously, we have no code in our hello function so letâ€™s fix that.

```python
def hello_world(name):
    return "Hello {}".format(name)

def test_hello():
    assert hello_world("World!") == "Hello World!"
```

Running `pytest hello.py` should now return:

```shell
collected 1 item
hello.py .                       [100%]

==================== 1 passed in 0.04 seconds ======================
```

As you can see, itâ€™s pretty easy to get started with testing in python with pytest. Now that we have everything set up, weâ€™ll be going into more advanced features as the series continues.
