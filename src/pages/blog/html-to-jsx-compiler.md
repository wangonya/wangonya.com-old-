title: HTML to JSX Compiler

I just came across <a href="https://magic.reactjs.net/htmltojsx.htm" target="_blank">this</a> online HTML to JSX Compiler. If you're new (or not) to react and you're still having a little trouble with JSX, I think this tool is great for learning. Just paste in your HTML in the HTML editor on the left, and it'll be converted into valid JSX on the right.

I used it to convert a HTML page with svg and inline styling to JSX for my site's <a href="https://wangonya.com/404" target="_blank">404 page</a> and it worked great.
